DynamoDB is a hosted NoSQL database offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It offers:
- reliable performance even as it scales;
- a managed experience, so you won't be SSH-ing into servers to upgrade the crypto libraries;
- a small, simple API allowing for simple key-value access as well as more advanced query patterns.
